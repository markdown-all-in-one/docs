## Security

Markdown has no concept of security. A malicious workspace may tamper with generated HTML files by various means to attack your device.

Security advice is as below:

* [Discussion from markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/security.md)

* [Sanitizers recommended by Marked](https://marked.js.org/#usage)

* [Disallowed HTML tags on GitHub](https://github.github.com/gfm/#disallowed-raw-html-extension-)

* [HTML sanitizer whitelist for user content on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/kivikakk/622b5dcf395e26c49e2334f0eb19e6f9)

* [An HTML sanitization configuration extracted from GitHub](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-pipeline/blob/main/lib/html/pipeline/sanitization_filter.rb)
