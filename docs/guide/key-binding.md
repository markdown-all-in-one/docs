# Key binding

## Overview

Markdown All in One lets you perform common tasks directly from the keyboard.

A key binding is assigned only when it's necessary and essential. We try to balance popularity and conflicts.

The key bindings for basic **rich text editing** follow the conventions from other rich text editors.

As for **list editing**, we hook VS Code's default key bindings of selection editing, mainly including line operations and indentation operations. Although this may introduce some strange compatibility issues, its learning cost is the lowest.

This section lists out the default key bindings (keyboard shortcuts).
