# Key binding

## Overview

Markdown All in One lets you perform common tasks directly from the keyboard.

A key binding is assigned only when it's necessary and essential. We try to balance popularity and conflicts.

There is no "best", "dominant", or "one-for-all" solution. Our default key bindings manage to be intuitive with the lowest possible learning cost, although this may introduce some strange compatibility issues.

The key bindings for basic **rich text editing** follow the conventions from other rich text editors.

As for **list editing**, we hook VS Code's default key bindings of selection editing, mainly including line operations and indentation operations.

## Key binding reference

This section lists out the default key bindings (keyboard shortcuts).

Our command IDs all begin with `markdown.extension.`.
