# Markdown syntax and flavors

## Overview

There are a great number of Markdown flavors (also known as "dialect"). Some of them diverge significantly and are technically incompatible.

**Markdown All in One** focuses on **CommonMark** and **GitHub Flavored Markdown** (GFM), plus a few extensions urgently needed by the community.

Currently enabled support:

* [LaTeX math](https://github.com/waylonflinn/markdown-it-katex#syntax) (powered by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html))
* [YAML front matter](https://github.com/ParkSB/markdown-it-front-matter#valid-front-matter)
